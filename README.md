### This is a simple chrome extension for The ALX SE Intranet Dashboard. The extension allows you to switch between two themes - light mode (by default) and dark mode. It provides an easy and convenient way to change the theme of your browsing (learning) experience, making it more comfortable for your eyes by generating a dark mode that aims to reduce the eyestrain of the user.

<!-- ### This is feature-rich and is customizable in many ways throughout the UI. <-- SOON -->
